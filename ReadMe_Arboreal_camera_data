ReadMe – Arboreal camera traps
Species detected with arboreal camera traps in the years of 2022 (Unterluss) and 2023 (Winnefeld, Nienover, Unterluss, Goehrede). During 
In 2022, we deployed 25 cameras at one site (5 forest plots) in Northern Germany, as a pilot study, where we tested different camera-set ups, camera models, battery life, bait and non baited stations and the general feasibility of the study. In 2023 we expanded our study to 4 sites (20 forest plots) using 80 camera traps. Each forest plot had 4 cameras traps installed on trees: 3 cameras on the canopy (18 to 30 m) facing the tree branches and one closer to the ground (2 to 3m) facing the tree trunk Individual trees and camera spot were chosen accordingly to feasibility of climbing, canopy connectivity, and a good focal point for the camera.
File: Camera_data
Variables/Columns:
Camera / image variables:
id_plot – id of the plot: Site (1 to 8) ‘.’ Plot type (1=Pure Dougals-fir, 2=Mixed Douglas/beech, 3=Pure beech, 4=Mixed Spruce/beech, 5=Pure Norway Spruce)
plot_type–1=Pure Dougals-fir, 2=Mixed Douglas/beech, 3=Pure beech, 4=Mixed Spruce/beech, 5=Pure Norway Spruce
camera_number – camera unique number
card_number – card unique number
platform–  was a platform used to install the camera. Y=Yes. N=N. Platforms were always at heights from 2 to 3.5 meters.
effort_days–  how long was the specific camera active (in days).
IMG_number–  number of the video
Hour_h_mi–  hour when the video was recorded on hh:mm format
correct_time–  is the previous information the correct time of the video or any camera malfunction occurred, and time cannot be ascertained? TRUE=correct time, FALSE=incorrect time. Obs: all problematic dates were fixed and are correct, where as only times with correct_time=TRUE can be trusted
Date_m_d–  date when the video was recorded on MM:dd format
year–  year of the footage
id_occassion–  combine id camera with year, providing a unique identifier for each camera installation
Height–  height of installed camera

Animal species variables:
animal_species- Scientific name of animal species on the video
First and last video of the camera are also tagged here as “Start start” and “End end”
class – class of identified animal
order – order of identified animal 
family – family of identified animal


Tree variables:
tree_species_c – common name of the tree on which camera was installed (5 characters only; Dougl= Douglas-fir, Beech=Beech, Spruc=Norway spruce)
tree_species_s – scientific name of the tree on which camera was installed 
tree_number – number of the tree on which camera was installed 
id_tree–  unique identifier of the tree, considering all plots (plot_treenumber)
DBH–  diameter at breast height of the tree of installed camera
Max_tree_height–  Total Height of the tree
NDIV – Neighborhood diversity of tree
Species_type_NDIV - Neighborhood diversity of tree considering conifer as a one group together
Basal_area_m2 – Basal area in m2 of the tree
These following were estimated from allometric equations, not directly measured: 
Crown_radius95 – upper 95 % quantile of crown radius of the tree in meters
Number_live_branches – number of live branches
Mass_branches – biomass of branches in kg
